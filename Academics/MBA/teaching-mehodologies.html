         <h2>Teaching Learning Initiatives by Faculties:</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Good quality academic planning and monitoring is an essential element in providing a consistent response to ensure a sustainable future for the students and hence for the Institute. Naturally, it is important that the academic planning and monitoring process is consistent and well understood by the stakeholder, equally important is the monitoring of overall performance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Pedagogical initiatives:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Course outlines of all subjects and timetables planned for the forthcoming semester are shared with students well in advance before the commencement date of the semester, as given in the academic calendar. Course outlines are prepared by the designated faculty members as per their specialization, followed by a rigorous process of suggestions and validations from the subject experts and the Head.</li>
                <li>Course Outlines have all the relevant details about the courses, like textbook reference, details of assignments, ABCAS activities, session plans, as well as the session learning outcomes (SLOs), pedagogies to follow to deliver the course, assessment tools and their weightage, etc. Instructors share various course-related materials with students from time to time to enhance their knowledge, like case studies, important article notes, PPT, etc.ITM has developed two types of pedagogical methodology, before COVID-19 and during COVID-19.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Before Covid-19 Pandemic</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Before COVID-19 everything was in offline mode and the faculty used both chalk and board and audio-visual aids in teaching. Students were always encouraged to interact during the lecture hour for clarification. The faculty was using the following pedagogical tools for effective teaching-learning:</li>
        </ul>
         <ol>
            <li><h4>Interactive Classrooms:</h4>
                <p>Classrooms are well equipped with a projector and wi-fi so that use of the internet is possible for better projection of real corporate examples through external videos.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Activity-Based Continuous Assessment System (ABCAS):
            </h4>
            <p>For a continuous assessment of students focusing on improving their communication skills, individual and teamwork, and professional ethics, the department conducts an Activity-Based Continuous Assessment System (ABCAS) that includes.
<br>
                a. Open book test b. Case Study c. PPT Presentation/ Poster Presentation d. Simulation work/Market Survey e. Group Discussion</p>
        </li>
        <li><h4>Flipped Classroom:</h4>
            <p>Flipped technology which is student-centered teaching is practiced. It encourages students to think out-of-the-box ideas. Adapting to this teaching and learning methodology enables the students to effectively show interest and involve themselves in learning.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Project-Based Learning (PBL):</h4>
            <p>The department acknowledges the sufficient exposure of the students to project management, teamwork, and communication skills. In the MBA program as per curriculum, the student has to submit two PBL, one is SIP-Summer Internship Project in the III semester and another one is Major Research Project in the IV semester.</p>

            <ol>
                <li><h4>Summer Internship Project:</h4>
                <p>The university curriculum offers a Summer Internship Project (SIP), which forms an important component of management education at the PG level. It is an effort to bridge the gap in students’ perceptions between theory in books and practice in the corporate world. As a part of SIP, students undertake a 45-60-day internship at any organization or company during the intervening period between the close of Semester II and the commencement of Semester III.
<br>
                    Every student will be allotted a Faculty Guide at the commencement of the SIP. The role of the Faculty Guide is to enable the student to undertake a meaningful project, offer the necessary academic guidance, and facilitate evaluation, with the aid of the company executives. The faculty guide would be involved at all stages of the SIP, beginning from ‘definition of the work content’ to project completion.
                    <br>
                    The training and placement cell of ITM assists students in getting internships in the best companies.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Major Research Project</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>As per the university curriculum, each student has to prepare a major research project in the 4th semester under the guidance of faculty.</li>
                    <li>Project work shall have the following stages:</li>
                    <li>A certificate of the project work shall be obtained from the faculty guide for project work completion. It shall be included in the project report.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Identification of projects and allocation methodology to Faculty Members </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The group of students (3-4) needs to give a research paper review of their choice in front of the PBL coordinator and faculty guide.</li>
                    <li>After brainstorming sessions with students, their project area will be decided.</li>
                    <li>Faculty expertise is used to assign a guide/mentor.</li>
                    <li>After topic finalization, students submit their synopsis, which is the first phase of the presentation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Collaborative learning:</h4>
            <p>Workshop by professionals, Industry Interaction, Alumni Mentorship program, etc.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>ICT supportive learning:
            </h4>
            <p>E-learning resources: a. NPTEL b. Ebsco host c. LMS -TATTVA-Virtual Campus</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h4>Industry interaction through Guest lectures and Industrial visits:</h4>
            <p>We believe that management education is incomplete without the support and collaboration of the industry. For this purpose, the department has developed strong linkages with the industry and renowned academic institutions. The interfacing with the industry helps the students through:</p>
            <p> <b>Guest Lectures:</b>  Guest lectures by prominent industrial personnel and faculty from reputed institutions are organized regularly. This provides students with a platform to interact with academic and industry professionals.</p>
