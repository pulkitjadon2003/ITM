                <p>Mechanical engineering is one of the oldest and broadest engineering disciplines that apply the principles of engineering, physics and materials science, Mathematics for analysis, design, manufacturing, and maintenance of mechanical systems. It is the branch of engineering that involves the production and usage of heat and mechanical power for the design, production, and operation /Maintenance of machines and tools required for process/chemical industries, refineries and petrochemicals, fertilizers, air separation plants and cryogenics, power plants and infrastructure projects. This engineering field requires an understanding of core concepts including mechanics, kinematics, thermodynamics, materials science, structural analysis, and electricity.
<br>
                    Mechanical engineers use these core principles along with tools like computer-aided engineering, and product life-cycle management to design and analyze manufacturing plants, industrial equipment and machinery, heating and cooling systems, transport systems, aircraft, marines, robotics, medical devices, weapons, and others.
                 <br>   
                    Mechanical engineering field has continually evolved to incorporate advancements in technology, and mechanical engineers today are pursuing research /developments in such fields as composites, mechatronics, and nanotechnology. Mechanical engineering is adding additional inputs for aerospace engineering, metallurgical engineering, civil engineering, electrical engineering, petroleum engineering, manufacturing engineering, chemical engineering, and other engineering disciplines to varying amounts.
                   <br> 
                    Mechanical engineers may also work in the field of Biomedical engineering, specifically with biomechanics, transport phenomena, mechatronics, nanotechnology and modeling of biological systems, like soft tissue mechanics.
                    <br>
                    A versatile and most-sought-after branch, manned by highly qualified and experienced (Academic and Industrial) faculty members with adequate infrastructure and lab facilities.</p>
