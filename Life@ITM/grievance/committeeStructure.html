            <p>To further institutionalize the innovation ecosystem, our institute has established a
                well-structured Institute Innovation Council (IIC). This council comprises deans, heads
                of departments, and faculty members who bring diverse expertise and perspectives to
                
                the table. The IIC is responsible for strategizing, overseeing, and promoting innovation-
                related activities within the institute. By involving senior academic leaders, the council
                
                ensures that innovation remains a strategic priority and is integrated into the academic
                and research agenda of the institute.</p>
          
            <p>In an era marked by rapid technological advancements and evolving market
                dynamics, fostering innovation and entrepreneurship is crucial for sustaining economic
                growth and addressing global challenges. Recognizing this, our institute has
                meticulously crafted an ecosystem that not only supports innovations but also facilitates
                the creation and transfer of knowledge. This comprehensive approach is exemplified by
                the approval and implementation of the National Innovation and Start-up Policy (Govt)
                , which aims to nurture ideas from conception to realization. Below mentioned
                Departments/Offices/Cell/Clubs are mainly involved in developing the innovation
                ecosystem in the Institute.</p>

                <h3>Makers Lab</h3>
                <p>
                    Our institute recognizes the importance of hands-on experience and practical
skills in driving innovation. To this end, we have established the Makers Lab, a
dedicated space focused on robotics and its popularization. The Makers Lab provides
students with the resources and guidance needed to design, prototype, and test their
robotic innovations. By promoting interdisciplinary collaboration and experiential
learning, the lab encourages students to explore the frontiers of technology and develop
solutions that address real-world problems.
Dedicated to the relentless pursuit of innovation, the Makers Lab serves as a platform
for students passionate about the fascinating fields of drones, industrial robots, and
humanoid robots. Here, we foster an environment that nurtures creativity,
collaboration, and hands-on learning, empowering our members to turn their
imaginative concepts into tangible realities.
