                <p style="width: 70%;">Welcome to the Department of Management! <br> <br>
                    At the Department of Management, we strive to create future business leaders who
                    are not only adept at navigating the complexities of the corporate world but are
                    also equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to make ethical and
                    impactful decisions. Our curriculum is designed to offer a holistic learning
                    experience, combining theoretical foundations with practical applications. <br> <br>
                    We believe in fostering a learning environment that encourages innovation, critical
                    thinking, and leadership development. With a strong focus on academic rigor and
                    industry relevance, we aim to bridge the gap between classroom learning and real-
                    world challenges. Our dedicated faculty, industry collaborations, and state-of-the-
                    art facilities ensure that our students receive an education that is both relevant and
                    forward-thinking. <br><br>
                    As the Head of the Department, it is my privilege to lead a team of dynamic
                    educators and researchers who are committed to excellence. <br><br>
                    We invite you to explore the opportunities that the Department of Management
                    offers, and we look forward to helping you achieve your academic and professional
                    goals.

                    <br><br><br>
                    Warm Regards,

                </p>
