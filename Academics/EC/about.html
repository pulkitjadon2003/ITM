                <p>Electronics & Communication engineering today is a multidisciplinary field that blends ingredients from electrical engineering, computer science engineering, information technology, and others. The Communication field now serves broader industries where the telephony, cellular, computer, data warehouse and entertainment industries have converged. It affects society in many aspects, including health, business, defense, security, space, banking, and social life.
<br>
                    Thus, as never before, a situation has arisen where a strong scientific manpower with technical background is needed to meet the growing challenges in the field of electronics for its research, development and applications. To achieve this, our energies are directed towards blending a sound understanding of fundamental science, engineering and technological aspects of electronics. The under graduate course of Electronics & Communication was started in 1997. The department has always been on a high growth path which reflected through M.Tech. in Embedded system & VLSI design in 2007. The department was accredited by National Board of Accreditation in 2009. The department has received grants from govt. agencies for up-gradation and modernization of laboratories.</p>
