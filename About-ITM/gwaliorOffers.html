            <p>Gwalior is a historical city in the heart of India, situated in the State of Madhya Pradesh. The Ancient Indian Classical School of Music “Dhrupad” was finetuned here and spread to various parts of India to acquire local flavours. Known as “The City of Music”, the legendary musician Tansen also belonged to Gwalior and became one of the nine jewells of

<br> <br>
                Emperor Akbar’s court. Tansen innovated many complex & beautiful ‘Ragas’. Thereafter the city responded so well to music that few members of every family took classical music as their life time passion. Daily practice sessions in each household used to give out-of-the-world feeling to the city. Just 3-4 decades ago joint families crumbled to growing economic pressures and musicians became jobless in independent India with no patronage from any quarter. Gwalior still has very sensible and sensitive audience of music and musicians find it very satisfying to perform here and receive proper responses from the audiences.
                
             <br> <br>   
                The city has perhaps the richest musical tradition among all the cities in this great country starting from Tansen, Baijubabra, Hassukhan, Haddukhan, Krishnarao Pandit, Bala Saheb Puchhwale, Chote Bhayya Puchhwale, Bande Ali Khan, Shankar Rao Pandit and to come to the living legends Malini Rajurkar, Ustad Amjad Ali Khan, the list is endless.
