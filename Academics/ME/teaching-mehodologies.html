         <h2>Innovations by the Faculty in Teaching and Learning</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Teaching effectiveness can be brought by understanding the models of instructions that capture, delineate, and transfer the knowledge from faculty members to the learners. These involve a deep understanding of subject matter, planning, classroom instructional strategies, assessment of understanding of students, and analysis of learning outcomes.</li>
            <li>Our methodologies are open for enhancement. Some of our Teaching-Learning Methodologies are Classroom Teaching, Tutorial Sessions particularly for analytical and programming subjects, Assignments, Snap Talk, Theory cum Laboratory classes, Experiments beyond Syllabus, Project-Based Learning, Value Aided Courses, Online courses, Technical Presentations, Weekend Activities, Industrial Visit, Industrial Trainings.</li>
         </ul>

         <ol>
            <li><h4>Classroom Teaching</h4>
                <p>The classrooms of the institute are equipped with chalk and talk along with PowerPoint presentation facilities. Classroom teaching enables the student to learn more dynamically, through different forms of information. All interactive modules such as videos and presentations are used in classrooms. This method of teaching attracts the students. Classes help students to connect concepts easily with animated visuals. The audio-visual senses of the students are targeted and it helps the students to grab the information effectively.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Theory cum laboratory courses</h4>
                <p>The demonstration method of laboratory courses combined with a well-guided discussion is a successful teaching technique. Practical sessions are designed in such a way that includes both theory and laboratory components. Theory cum laboratory curriculum ensures that students grasp concepts effectively through virtual laboratories.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Online courses</h4>
                <p>Faculty members and students attend online courses on Coursera, NPTEL, Spoken tutorial, in their area of interest. This helps them to enrich their knowledge on the current trends and also equip them with inter-domain expertise. They are certified by National and International universities and are motivated towards lifelong learning. Online courses also provide a forum for discussion among experts and students worldwide.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Learning Management System</h4>
                <p>Learning Management System (Tattva) is a platform designed to enhance the learning experience which is incorporated in our teaching-learning process. It helps to interact with students 24 X 7, by posting interactive video lectures, study materials, notes, quizzes, activity-based projects and assignments. It also facilitates to conduct and evaluate online quizzes. The tools offer opportunities for collaboration in real-time and the ability to work remotely.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Problem-based learning</h4>
                <p>Projects based on real-time engineering problems are offered which help students to understand and come out with the solutions. Group assignments are also given to the students to improve their self-learning and teamwork. Project Exhibitions are conducted in the department every year to enrich the project developing skills of the students.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Technical presentation</h4>
                <p>Students are encouraged to give presentations on any technical topics in their area of interest which serves the purpose of knowledge transfer and removes stage fear also. It improves their communication skills which are significant in their career growth.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Co-curricular and extracurricular activities</h4>
                <p>Co-curricular and extracurricular activities are conducted to encourage the students and to improve problem-solving capabilities, leadership abilities in multidisciplinary fields, co-operation in teamwork, realization in professional ethics, and administration during critical situations. These activities include webinars, aptitude training, social welfare camp, problem-solving activities, entrepreneurship development programs, critical thinking forums, group discussions.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Industrial Visit /Training/ Internship</h4>
                <p>Industrial visits and training are organized for students to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical training in a real-life environment. Students understand the industrial practices and organizational hierarchy during industrial visits. Industrial visits/internships provide opportunities for active/interactive learning experiences outside the classroom environment, in addition to the usual classroom learning.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Snap Talk</h4>
                <p>Students are motivated to present a topic based on classroom teaching for 5 minutes during class hours for improving technical knowledge.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Value Added Courses</h4>
                <p>Certification courses are conducted by the department to give key knowledge to the students in specific fields. It improves employability skills and stimulates the professional and life-oriented skills of the students.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Interactive Video</h4>
                <p>Interactive video content for online classes and Interactive H5P videos are accessible through Tattva-LMS of the institute. The objective of Interactive Videos is to make students feel the classroom teaching. They are provided MCQs, short answer-type questions, or questions based on a summarized session at the last. The interactive Teaching Methodology evokes curiosity among students which aid in self-evaluation. One more positive feedback towards the interactive approach is that students can also revise their lectures even when they missed a topic.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Online Lab Manuals</h4>
                <p>Lab manuals are prepared by expert faculty of the course and are made available on LMS Tattva/labs for students. Apart from theory lectures, the assignments, quizzes, & recorded lab sessions provide students with a conceptual understanding of lab experiments. Students complete practice questions also by using Lab manuals for every lab-related course.</p>
            </li>

            <li><h4>Online Grades Evaluation</h4>
                <p>Brainstorming assignment questions and quizzes are provided and evaluated through LMS Tattva. This process is transparent and students can also monitor their performance.</p>
